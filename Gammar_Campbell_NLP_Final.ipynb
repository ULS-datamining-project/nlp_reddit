    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyse reddit posts to discover trends in healthy eating on food subreddits. We will attempt the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download a series of posts from reddit using their API\n",
    "- Characterise these posts using exploratory analysis\n",
    "- Predict whether a subreddit is a healthy eating subreddit based on its post content\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Reddit?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit is a social media site where users post either links around the web or text content that they've written themselves. These posts are subject to a an upvote/downvote system which causes popular submissions to rise higher onto users' feeds. Older posts have lower weighted upvotes, resulting in a constant feed of new, highly regarded content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reddit's style is casual, but serious. Posts are generally typed out in full sentences with emojis and reaction images being comparatively rare. This makes it an ideal candidate for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Read in data\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is rendered as markdown rather than a code block as it takes approximately 40 minutes to run. We've provided CSVs to save you the trouble. These are to be placed in a `data/` subdirectory. Multireddits are groups of subreddits grouped by a common theme. We did a Google search for a \"food multireddit\" and [came across a general one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/cg7lha/misc_heres_all_of_the_food_related_subreddits_i/) made by Reddit user [Nomeii](https://www.reddit.com/user/Nomeii/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the [Python Reddit API Wrapper (praw)](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to loop through each of these subreddits picking the top 1000 most upvoted posts from the past year. We saved this as a csv and will be using this as the base of our of our future analysis."
